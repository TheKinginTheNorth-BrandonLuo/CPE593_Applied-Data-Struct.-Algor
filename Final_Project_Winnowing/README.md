# Copy Detection Based OnWinnowing Algorithm
Nowadays, most of documents are produced
in digital format, in which they can be easily
accessed and copied. Document copy detection
is a very important tool for protecting the
authorâ€™s copyright.The Winnowing algorithm
is a fingerprint based text similarity detection
method. This paper makes a literature study
of Winnowing, a fingerprinting algorithm for
documents. The Winnowing selects fingerprints
from hashes of k-grams, a contiguous
substring of length k. We study different Kgrams
sizes and different winnowing windows
size. We show the result and propose the improvement
for this algorithm.
