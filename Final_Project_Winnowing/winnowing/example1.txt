All previous requirements still apply.
You must remember to update your package.json file to set app.js as your starting script!
Your HTML must be valid (Links to an external site.) or you will lose points on the assignment.
Your HTML must make semantical sense; usage of tags for the purpose of simply changing the style of elements (such as i, b, font, center, etc) will result in points being deducted; think in terms of content first, then style with your CSS.
You can be as creative as you'd like to fulfill front-end requirements; if an implementation is not explicitly stated, however you go about it is fine (provided the HTML is valid and semantical). Design is not a factor in this course.
Your client side JavaScript must be in its own file and referenced from the HTML accordingly.
All inputs must be properly labeled!
